# SDBEditor Public Assets

This directory contains all public assets served by the SDBEditor web application.
After cloning, most folders are empty (just `.gitkeep` placeholders). Use the
**Initialize Folders** button on the Settings page or create them manually.

## Required Folder Structure

| Folder | Purpose | How to populate |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| `dbc/` | Base DBC files from the WoW 3.3.5 client | Extract with DBC tools or copy from client data |
| `custom-dbc/` | Modified DBC files (Talent.dbc, SpellIcon.dbc) | Created automatically when you save in the editor |
| `icon/` | Base BLP icon files from the WoW client | Copy `Interface/Icons/*.blp` from client data |
| `custom-icon/` | User-uploaded BLP icons | Upload through Spell Icon Editor UI |
| `thumbnails/` | Auto-generated PNG previews of BLP icons | Generated automatically on server start |
| `sprites/` | Auto-generated per-class sprite sheets | Generated automatically on server start |
| `export/DBFilesClient/` | Exported DBC files ready for client patching | Created when you save talents or icons |
| `export/Interface/` | Exported icon files ready for client patching | Created on export |
| `error-logs/` | Frontend/backend error logs | Created automatically by the server |

## Included Assets (tracked in git)

These folders contain the base UI assets and **should not be deleted**:

- **`class-icons/`** — 10 class selection icons (`icon-warrior.png`, etc.)
- **`class-backgrounds/`** — 30 talent tree background images (`bg-warrior-arms.jpg`, etc.)
- **`vite.svg`** — Vite default favicon

## Auto-Generated Files (git-ignored)

These files are created automatically by the server and do not need manual setup:

| File | Generated by |
|------|-------------|
| `spell-icon-index.json` | Built from `Spell.dbc` + `SpellIcon.dbc` on startup |
| `icon-manifest.json` | Built from BLP scan on startup |
| `icons-manifest.json` | Built from BLP scan on startup |
| `config.json` | Created on first settings save |

## Quick Setup

1. **Clone the repo** — folders exist but are empty
2. **Start the server** — `./webserver` from the `web/` directory
3. **Go to Settings** → click **Initialize Folders** to ensure all directories exist
4. **Copy your WoW client data:**
   - DBC files → `public/dbc/`
   - Icon BLPs → `public/icon/`
5. The server auto-generates thumbnails, sprites, and manifests on startup

## File Formats

- **BLP** — Blizzard Picture format (WoW icon images)
- **DBC** — Database Client files (WoW binary data tables)
- **PNG** — Generated thumbnails and sprite sheets

## Version Control

All large/binary/generated content is excluded via `.gitignore`.
Directory structure is preserved with `.gitkeep` files so folders exist after clone.

User-uploaded and user-modified files live in `custom-*` directories,
keeping original game data separate and untouched.
